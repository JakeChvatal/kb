#+title: Configuration for Keyboards

These configuration files are managed with GNU Stow;
to build them, clone qmk firmware at the same top level directory,
cd into this repo, then run ```stow planck``` for the planck keyboard.

This configuration takes heavy inspiration from many of the existing
qmk keymappings, most notably [[https://thedarnedestthing.com][sdothum's work]].

For now, the only keyboard supported is the OLKB Plank,
but there are plans to support other keyboards in the future, such as the
Kyria and the Corne keyboards (which I have yet to build).

As such, keymappings are factored into modules (macro groups),
and these modules are included in keymappings for specific keyboards.

Better documentation is coming soon, pending a finalization of my layout.
