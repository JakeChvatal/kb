#+title: Configuration for Keyboards

This configuration takes heavy inspiration from many of the existing
qmk keymappings, most notably [[https://thedarnedestthing.com][sdothum's work]].

For now, the only keyboard supported is the OLKB Plank,
but there are plans to support other keyboards in the future, such as the
Kyria and the Corne keyboards (which I have begun the slow process of building).

(My choice here is the Corne over the Kyria).

As such, keymappings are factored into modules (macro groups),
and these modules are included in keymappings for specific keyboards.

Better documentation is coming soon, pending a finalization of my layout.

Remember to use `sudo` to rebuild - dfu-util doesn't have the privilege to
see devices otherwise!
